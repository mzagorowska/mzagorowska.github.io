<img align="left" src="/assets/Blank_Europe_Map_collab.svg" alt="Collaborations"  hspace="20"> I started my academic career by obtaining combined degrees in mathematics and control engineering from [AGH University of Science and Technology](https://www.agh.edu.pl/). My theoretical knowledge came useful when I joined [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) in 2016 to pursue my PhD in Process Control under joint supervision of Prof Nina Thornhill and Dr Charlotte Skourup from ABB Energy Industries in Oslo. My solution-oriented approach and creative ideas were recognized in the form of two awards I obtained for my PhD. I won the [2020 IET Control & Automation Doctoral Dissertation Prize](https://engx.theiet.org/b/blogs/posts/announcing-the-winner-of-our-phd-award-2020) and [2020 Dudley Newitt Prize for Theoretical/Computational Excellence](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/student-records-and-data/for-current-students/graduate-prizes/postgraduate-prizes/). After obtaining my PhD I joined the group of Prof. Eric Kerrigan at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College London to deepen my knowledge on computational approaches to optimisation and control of sustainable buildings. After a brief collaboration with Dr Mehmet Mercangoez at Imperial College, in 2022 I moved to ETH Zurich, where I joined the group of Prof John Lygeros at [IfA](https://control.ee.ethz.ch/) to work on integration of learning and control. In the meantime, I got a Marie Curie individual postdoctoral fellowship, and in 2023 I joined NTNU in Norway, to work on Robust and data-Efficient Learning for Industrial Control [RELIC](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101063948). Since September 2024, I am an [assistant professor at the Delft Center for Systems and Control](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/m.a.zagorowska/?cHash=4017a62fa79f9af7327d078544a99c2f) at TU Delft in the Netherlands.

My long-term research vision is motivated by bridging the gap between academia and industry by providing tailored mathematical methods.
